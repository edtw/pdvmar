# Security Analysis & Implementation Status

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: CPF-Based Access Control

### Security Gap Fixed:
**Problem:** Anyone with QR code could access/modify ANY table's order
**Solution:** Mandatory CPF verification for all customer actions

### Implementation Details:

#### 1. Backend Security Middleware (`/server/middlewares/orderAccess.js`)
- **`verifyCustomerAccess`** - Validates CPF matches order's customer before allowing modifications
- **`verifyTableAccess`** - Checks table occupation status and CPF when creating commands
- **`verifyStaffAccess`** - Allows Admin/Waiter/Kitchen/Manager to bypass customer restrictions

#### 2. Updated Routes (`/server/routes/customerRoutes.js`)
All sensitive endpoints now protected:
- `POST /commands` - Requires CPF to create command
- `POST /orders/:orderId/items` - Requires matching CPF to add items
- `DELETE /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId` - Requires matching CPF to remove items
- `POST /orders/:orderId/request-bill` - Requires matching CPF to request payment

#### 3. Controller Validation (`/server/controllers/customerController.js`)
- CPF is now **REQUIRED** (not optional)
- Validates CPF format (11 digits)
- Returns existing order if CPF matches (welcome back flow)
- Denies access if CPF doesn't match occupied table

#### 4. Customer App Updates
- **CreateCommand.js**: CPF field now required with security message
- **api.js**: Automatically sends stored CPF with all requests
- **Session Storage**: Stores CPF after command creation for subsequent requests

## 🔒 Security Features

### Who Can Access an Occupied Table:

1. **The Customer** - Must provide the same CPF used to create the order
2. **Admin** - Full access (via JWT authentication)
3. **Waiter** - Can manage any table assigned to them
4. **Kitchen Staff** - Can view orders to prepare items
5. **Manager** - Full oversight access

### Security Flow:

```
Customer scans QR Code
  ↓
Enters Name + CPF (REQUIRED)
  ↓
Server checks if table is occupied
  ↓
  If FREE → Create new order
  If OCCUPIED by same CPF → Return existing order (welcome back)
  If OCCUPIED by different CPF → DENY ACCESS ❌
  If OCCUPIED by waiter → DENY ACCESS ❌
  ↓
CPF stored in sessionStorage
  ↓
All subsequent requests include CPF
  ↓
Server validates CPF matches before allowing modifications
```

**Features Needed:**
- Login for waiters
- View assigned tables
- Receive real-time order notifications
- Mark items as delivered
- Process payments
- View order history
- Mobile-optimized interface

### 3. Kitchen Display App 👨‍🍳
**Purpose:** Dedicated app for kitchen staff to receive and manage orders
**Features Needed:**
- Real-time order reception from customers
- Order queue management
- Mark items as preparing/ready
- Filter by category (drinks, food, desserts)
- Sound/visual alerts for new orders
- Large, clear display for kitchen environment
- Timer for preparation tracking

### 4. Direct Customer → Kitchen Flow ⚡
**Current:** Orders go to general system
**Needed:** Direct notification pipeline from customer orders to kitchen display

## 📝 Testing Checklist

### Security Tests:
- [ ] Create order with CPF on table 1

- [ ] Try to access table 1 order with correct CPF → Should ALLOW
- [ ] Try to add item to table 1 without CPF → Should DENY
- [ ] Try to add item to table 1 with wrong CPF → Should DENY
- [ ] Try to add item to table 1 with correct CPF → Should ALLOW
- [ ] Admin logs in and accesses any table → Should ALLOW
- [ ] Waiter accesses assigned table → Should ALLOW
- [ ] Kitchen views order → Should ALLOW (read-only)
